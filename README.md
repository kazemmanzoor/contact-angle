# contact-angle
Matlab codes to calculate solid-liquid contact angle from Molecular Dynamics simulations

These Matlab codes calculate the solid-liquid contact angle from Molecular Dynamics simulations of liquid droplets on solid substrats. All codes read LAMMPS trajectory files. For moredetails of theory behind each method and proper citation of codes please refer to the following publication:
