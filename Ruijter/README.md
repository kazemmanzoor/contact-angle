# Method of de Ruijter et al.
*M. J. de Ruijter, T. D. Blake, and J. De Coninck, Langmuir 15, 7836 (1999)*

All algorithms were coded in __MATLAB Version 8.6.0.267264__ and designed to read __LAMMPS dump files__ as inputs.
Functions:

* __R_Ruijter__: This function calculates the contact angle of a liquid droplet on a solid surface through a circular fitting to the boundary points.

* __run_Ruijter.m__: This is a sample run file to perform contact angle calculation.
