# Method of Fan and Cagin

*C. F. Fan and T. Cain, The Journal of Chemical Physics 103, 9053 (1995)*

All algorithms were coded in __MATLAB Version 8.6.0.267264__ and designed to read __LAMMPS dump__ files as inputs. Functions:

* __Convex_VS.m__: This Function calculates the volume and surface area of a data set through convex hull triangulation.

* __run_Fan.m__: This is a sample run file to perform contact angle calculation.
